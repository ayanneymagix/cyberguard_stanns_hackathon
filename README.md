# CyberGuard 7.0 🛡️

**Autonomous AI-Powered Defense Against Modern Phishing Attacks**

CyberGuard is an advanced, autonomous security agent designed to bridge the gap between traditional email filters and modern, AI-driven phishing attacks. It is built to operate at machine speed while reasoning with analyst-level intelligence.

By implementing a **Hybrid “Max-Score” Architecture**, CyberGuard fuses:

* **Deep Learning (BERT)** for linguistic and semantic pattern recognition
* **Heuristic Logic Engine** for deterministic, rule-based threat detection

This fusion enables accurate, explainable, and real-time phishing defense.

> CyberGuard acts as a digital Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst — without human latency.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Modern phishing attacks have outpaced legacy defenses:

* AI-generated emails bypass keyword-based filters
* Screenshot and image-based phishing defeats text-only analysis
* Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks exploit human trust
* Zero-day malicious domains evade blacklist-based systems
* Human analysts require **15–20 minutes per email**, making real-time defense impossible

Traditional tools are reactive, slow, and blind to multimodal threats.

## 💡 Solution Overview

CyberGuard introduces an **autonomous, hybrid AI security agent** that combines machine learning, rule-based intelligence, and behavioral analysis to detect sophisticated phishing attacks with **near-zero latency (<200ms)**.

### Core Detection Capabilities

* 🧠 **Semantic intent analysis** using BERT
* 🖼️ **Image & screenshot phishing detection (Quishing)**
* 🏢 **Business Email Compromise (BEC) identification**
* 🌐 **Zero-day domain risk analysis**
* ⚡ **Sub-200ms autonomous threat scoring**

## 🧬 Hybrid “Max-Score” Architecture (Core Innovation)

CyberGuard evaluates threats using multiple independent detection engines. Each engine produces a risk score, and the **maximum confidence score determines the final decision**, ensuring no weak signal is ignored.

### Detection Engines

1. **Deep Learning Engine (BERT)**

   * Linguistic pattern recognition
   * Semantic intent understanding
   * Psychological and social engineering cues

2. **Heuristic Logic Engine (Rulebook)**

   * Deterministic threat rules
   * Known attack indicators
   * High-precision safety net

> Max-Score Fusion ensures both adaptability and reliability.
